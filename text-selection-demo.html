<h2>Demo measures to prevent text selections</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Using CSS</h4>
<div class='box noselect'>
    Text selection in this section has been disabled using CSS only. We simply set the
    user-select property and as well as its prefixed alternatives to 'none'.  This
    method can be effective because it requires no JavaScript; Because CSS style sheets
    are typically loaded in the &lt;HEAD&gt; of the document, they take effect immediately.
    <br/><br/>
    <input class="noselect" type="text" placeholder="enter text, then try to select it"
           value="Can you copy this to your clipboard?">
</div>

<h4>Using JS events bound by html attributes</h4>
<div class='box' ondragstart="blockSelections(event)"
     onmousedown="blockSelections(event)" onmouseup="blockSelections(event)"
     oncontextmenu="blockSelections(event)" onselect="blockSelections(event)">

    Text selection in this section has been disabled by setting the HTML attributes
    that bind to event handlers.  The attributes 'onmousedown', 'onmouseup', 'oncontextmenu',
    and 'onselect' were all set to a JavaScript function that blocks typical browser behavior
    by calling event.preventDefault(). To the textbox below we also added an onkeydown handler
    that prevents the typical copy, cut and paste shortcuts.
    <br/><br/>
    <input  ondragstart="blockSelections(event)"
            onmousedown="blockSelections(event)" onmouseup="blockSelections(event)"
            oncontextmenu="blockSelections(event)" onselect="blockSelections(event)"
            onkeydown="interceptKeys(event)"
            type="text" placeholder="enter text, then try to copy it"
            value="What about this text? Can you copy this?">
</div>

<h4>Using purely Javascript</h4>
<div id="one" class="box">
    Text selection in this section has been disabled by setting 'onmousedown', 'onmouseup'... properties
    to the same function as in the previous section. The only difference is that in the HTML attributes
    that bind to event handlers were set not in HTML as was done above, but in JavaScript. Selection
    within the textbox was disabled in JavaScript as well (not in HTML). In addition, the 'disabled'
    attribute was set. This is one of the easiest and most effective ways to prevent
    selection because the browser blocks all interactions with the disabled textbox.

    <input id="two" type="text" placeholder="enter text, then try to copy it"
           value="And finally... can you copy this?">

        console.log('preventing "'+e.type+'"');
